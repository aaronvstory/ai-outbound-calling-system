# GitHub Setup Instructions
# Note: Git is not available in the WebContainer environment
# These commands would need to be run in a local development environment with Git installed

# To set up GitHub integration locally:
# 1. Install Git on your local machine
# 2. Initialize a Git repository: git init
# 3. Add remote origin: git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
# 4. Add files: git add .
# 5. Commit changes: git commit -m "Initial commit"
# 6. Rename branch to main: git branch -M main
# 7. Push to GitHub: git push -u origin main

# For WebContainer deployment, use the built-in deployment options instead
